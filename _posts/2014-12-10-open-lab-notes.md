title: Open Lab Notes
subtitle: An Ongoing Case Study From octavius labs
---

Inspired by Bell Laboratories and Xerox Park, I’ve always wanted to create a company where the exploration of ideas is a founding principal. Thankfully, we live in a time where ideas can be coded, compiled, and distributed in a few clicks. If viable, these ideas become products that create value for people all around the world.

[octavius labs](http://www.octaviuslabs.com?ref=blog) is the realization of this dream. We are an R&D company that thinks and experiments deeply in the SaaS space to find marketing or productivity products that help people.
But this shouldn’t only be my dream.

As a part of the octavius process, we will publish an ongoing case study known as Open Lab Notes. In these notes we will share some data, hacks, and the process that we use to make all of our products.
For the budding entrepreneurs, we hope to serve as inspiration. There aren’t many case studies from day zero, hopefully our notes will jolt you into action. If you’re in the trenches, we hope to help you “unblock” or give you new ideas that move the needle.

For everyone in-between, we hope that we can help you see the world in a different way.
